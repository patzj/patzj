# 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a software developer passionate about offensive web security and secure application design. With hands-on experience finding and exploiting vulnerabilities, I apply an attacker's mindset to build stronger defenses. I enjoy breaking applications to uncover weaknesses and then reinforcing them to be more resilient, scalable, and secure.
